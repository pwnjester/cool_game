# These are manas' dumb idiotic ideas:

- minecraft modding (stupid idea, we will never do this)
- mods for other games (also lame and stupid)
- some app
- google docs but for programming (not doing this one)
- some game (story is a requirement)
    - rouguelite (not everything lost, you have some things that save across games)
    - potentially a card game kinda thing (semi a joke)
- an operating system (we could try writing one in a language that people dont know a ton about)
    what would make this stand out?
    - manas wants to make his own DE
    - javascript os (wonderful)
    - maybe rust
    - maybe zig
    - **not swift** (bad, boo)
