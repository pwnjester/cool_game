**Abilites**
-Rather than "learning" permanant abilties that have cooldowns, you would rather collect cards that would have 1 use. More cards you collect, the more uses you get. Depending on how good the card is, there will be limited uses. If you collect a card when you can no longer hold the card, the card will be scrapped and turned into "Elixir".
