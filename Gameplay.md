**Abilites**
-Rather than "learning" permanant abilties that have cooldowns, you would rather collect cards that would have 1 use. More of the same cards that you collect, they will merge and you will gain more uses (Ex: If I had one card, and I collected another of the same card, the second card would stack with the first, and it will gain 2 uses instead of one). Depending on how good the card is, you will be limited to how many times you can stack itt. If you collect a card when you no longer have the space for, the card will be scrapped and turned into "Elixir".
